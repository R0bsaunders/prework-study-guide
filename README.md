# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

To provide a learner with a website to logcially store notes taken throughout the course as well as a sandbox that can be used to practise and apply the code and knowledge being taught. During the learnign process, a vast amount of resources are given to the learner which can become difficult to locate when using paper or electronic notes so this website project allows a learner to quickly access information learnt over time and in one place. As this is course is an intensive one, having a logical, well-organised place to store notes will be invaluable. The second benefit to building this website is that all topics learnt can be applied in the real world allowing the learner to 'see it in action' as they learn to code. 

Through the process of buidlgin this webiste, I learnt the very basaics of:

GitHub: How to create a repository, branches and keep local and cloud up to date with commit, push and how to create pull requests
HTML: That the structure of a website is the HTML
CSS: The visual elements of the website and how they are linked via the HTML elements
JavaScript: How to make a website interactive

One of the key take aways that I took away, that I found extremely empowering, was surprisingly not code related! The most empowering and important thing I learnt was the importance of a grwoth mindeset. There are still many things i didn't understand in this project, but the growth mindset taught me that I will be able to learn it, and that while I may not 'get it' now, in time, and with enough self-determination, I WILL UNDERSTAND IT! Learn that, and you can learn anything!
